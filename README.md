## Project Overview

Credit risk analysis is crucial for financial institutions to determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately assess credit risk.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to borrowers' credit history, financial background, and demographic information. Key features include:

- Loan amount
- Borrower's income
- Credit history
- Employment status
- Loan purpose
- Debt-to-income ratio

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/Sameer12062003/CREDIT-RISK-ASSESSMENT.git
### Navigate to the project directory:

cd credit-risk-analysis
### Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Credit Risk Analysis.ipynb"
Run the notebook cells to load the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, build and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Credit Risk Analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Results
The final model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Detailed results and visualizations are included in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Findings:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of features and target variable.
Feature Engineering: Techniques used to preprocess and transform the data for better model performance.
Model Building: Different classification algorithms used, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
Model Evaluation: Comparison of model performance using the evaluation metrics mentioned above.
